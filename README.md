# üî≠ SDSS Data Pipeline

A comprehensive Python pipeline for downloading, processing, and visualizing data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 19.

## Features

- **Direct Downloads**: Downloads SDSS catalogs directly from the official servers
- **Automatic Processing**: Converts FITS files to pandas DataFrames with cleaning
- **Rich Visualizations**: Creates publication-quality plots including:
  - Sky distribution maps
  - Redshift distributions
  - Color-magnitude diagrams
  - Data quality metrics
- **Memory Efficient**: Handles large datasets with configurable row limits
- **Multiple Catalogs**: Support for optical spectra, APOGEE, and ASTRA data

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. Clone or download this repository

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the complete pipeline with default settings:

```python
python sdss_pipeline.py
```

This will:
1. Download the optical spectroscopic catalog (~985 MB compressed)
2. Process 10,000 objects (configurable)
3. Create comprehensive visualizations
4. Save processed data as Parquet file

### Advanced Usage

```python
from sdss_pipeline import SDSSPipeline

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = SDSSPipeline(data_dir="sdss_data")

# List available catalogs
pipeline.list_available_catalogs()

# Run pipeline for specific catalog
df = pipeline.run(
    catalog='optical_spectra',  # or 'apogee_allstar', 'astra_summary'
    max_rows=50000  # None for all rows (memory intensive!)
)

# Access the data
print(df.head())
print(df.describe())
```

## Available Catalogs

- **optical_spectra**: SDSS-V optical spectroscopic data (v6_1_3)
- **apogee_allstar**: APOGEE stellar parameters (1.3)
- **apogee_allvisit**: APOGEE visit-level data (1.3)
- **astra_summary**: ASTRA pipeline results (0.6.0)

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ output_data_examples/    # Visualization outputs
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *.png                # Analysis plots
```

## Output Files

### Processed Data
- Location: `sdss_data/processed/`
- Format: Parquet (efficient columnar storage)
- Files: `{catalog_name}_processed.parquet`

### Visualizations
- Location: `output_data_examples/`
- Format: PNG (150 DPI)
- Includes: Sky maps, redshift distributions, color diagrams, etc.

## Memory Management

Large SDSS catalogs can be memory-intensive. Use the `max_rows` parameter to limit data:

```python
# Load only 10,000 rows (good for testing)
df = pipeline.run(catalog='optical_spectra', max_rows=10000)

# Load all rows (requires significant RAM)
df = pipeline.run(catalog='optical_spectra', max_rows=None)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Download Issues

If downloads fail:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify SDSS servers are accessible: https://dr19.sdss.org
3. Try downloading manually from the URLs in the code

### Memory Errors

If you encounter memory errors:
1. Reduce `max_rows` parameter
2. Close other applications
3. Process catalogs individually

### Missing Dependencies

If imports fail:
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Sources

All data downloaded from:
- **SDSS DR19**: https://dr19.sdss.org
- **Documentation**: https://www.sdss.org/dr19/
